## Scope

```
Define as it relates to Open Mobile Alliance Activity.  If it adds clarity, define what is not in the scope.  DELETE THIS COMMENT 
```

## References
### Normative References

```
The policy for reference lists is:
1.	OMA documents listed should have at least one approved version – draft-only docs should not be referenced.  
Exception exists for documents that will be approved with or after the referenced doc is approved (may be 
part of same enabler package).  In short – approved docs should not reference unapproved docs.
2.	When a reference is made to an OMA specification, then Open Mobile Alliance with the TM symbol (™) should 
be used in the description.
3.	The name + version (no date) for OMA specifications are generally sufficient – dates should be used only 
if there is a specific reason to limit the usage.
4.	For references to WAP Forum docs, dates should not be included as DID's for the old WAP Forum specifications 
are enough and the reference description should refer to WAP Forum™.
5.	References to other affiliate docs should similarly provide sufficient information to uniquely determine the 
needed document and should provide the appropriate source information.
6.	The URL for OMA material (new OMA and affiliate) should always be http://www.openmobilealliance.org (an 
exception is OMNA that is reached through http://www.openmobilealliance.org/tech/omna)
    
Models to use
	[REFLABEL]	<General Model> "Ref Title", Ref information (source, date, id), URL:http//<ref-source>/ 
	[OMADOC]	<OMA Model> "OMA Document Title",{ Version x.y,} Open Mobile Alliance™, OMA <docname>{ <version>}, 
                URL:http//www.openmobilealliance.org/ 

If there are no entries in the table – enter ‘none’ to be clear.
