**AV1 Codec ISO Media File Format Binding**
 
**Abstract** 
This document specifies the storage format for [AV1] bitstreams in [ISOBMFF] tracks as well as in[CMAF] files. 
 
# Bitstream features overview 

An *_AV1 bitstream_* is composed of a sequence of *OBUs*, grouped into *Temporal Units*.

OBUs are made of a 1 or 2 bytes header, identifying in particular the type of OBU, followed by an op-tional length field and by an optional payload, whose presence and content depend on the OBU type.Depending on its type, an OBU can carry configuration information, metadata, or coded video data.

```
NOTE: Tile List OBUs defined in the [AV1] specification are not supported in the current version of this specification. A future version of the specification may do so.
```
Temporal Units are processed by a decoder in the order given by the bitstream. Each Temporal Unit isassociated with a presentation time. Some Temporal Units may contain multiple frames to be decodedbut only one is presented.

```
NOTE: The AV1 specification defines scalability features, allowing frames from multiple layers oroperating points to be present in a single temporal unit. This version of storage in ISOBMFF sup-ports the simple storage of scalable streams in a single track, but does not specify advanced tools for handling multi-track support, layer extraction, or  other scalability related use cases. A futureversion of the specification may do so.
```

Frames carried in Temporal Units may have coding dependencies on frames carried previously in thesame Temporal Unit or in previous Temporal Units. Frames that can be decoded without dependencies to previous frames are of two categories: *Key Frames* and *Intra-only Frames*. Frames that cannot be decoded independently are of three categories: *Inter Frames, Switch Frames*, and frames with a *show_existing_frame* flag set to 1. 

Key Frames with the *show_frame* flag set to 1 have the additional property that after decoding the Key Frame, all frames following the Key Frame in the bitstream can be decoded. They are called *Random Access Points* in [AV1].

Key Frames with the *show_frame* flag set to 0 are called Delayed Random Access Points. Delayed Random Access Points have the additional property that if a future Key Frame Dependent Recovery Point exists, all frames following that Key Frame Dependent Recovery Point can be decoded. A Key Frame Dependent Recovery Point is a frame with show_existing_frame set to 1 that refers to a previ-ous Delayed *Random Access Points*.

# Basic Encapsulation Scheme

This section describes the basic data structures used to signal encapsulation of *AV1 bitstreams* in [ISOBMFF] containers.

## General Requirements & Brands

A file conformant to this specification satisfies the following:

- It SHALL conform to the normative requirements of [ISOBMFF]
- It SHALL have the *‘av01’* brand among the compatible brands array of the FileTypeBox
- It SHALL contain at least one track using an *AV1SampleEntry*
- It SHOULD indicate a structural ISOBMFF brand among the compatible brands array of the File-TypeBox, such as *‘iso6’*
- It MAY indicate CMAF brands as specified in *§3 CMAF AV1 track format*
- It MAY indicate other brands not specified in this document provided that the associated require-ments do not conflict with those given in this specification

Parsers SHALL support the structures required by the *‘iso6’* brand and MAY support structures re-quired by further ISOBMFF structural brands.

## AV1 Sample Entry

### Definitions

```
Sample Entry Type: av01
Container:         Sample Description Box ('stsd')
Mandatory:         Yes
Quantity:          One or more.
```
### Description
The **_AV1SampleEntry_** sample entry identifies that the track contains *AV1 Samples*, and uses an *AV1-CodecConfigurationBox*.

### Syntax
```
class AV1SampleEntry extends VisualSampleEntry('av01') {  
AV1CodecConfigurationBox config;
}
```
### Semantics

The **_width_** and **_height_** fields of the *VisualSampleEntry* SHALL equal the values of *max_frame_width_minus_1* + 1 and *max_frame_height_minus_1* + 1 of the *Sequence Header OBU* applying to the samples associated with this sample entry.

The width and height in the TrackHeaderBox SHOULD equal, respectively, the maximum Render-Width, called MaxRenderWidth, and the maximum RenderHeight, called MaxRenderHeight, of all theframes associated with this sample entry. Additionally, if MaxRenderWidth and MaxRenderHeightvalues do not equal respectively the *max_frame_width_minus_1* + 1 and *max_frame_height_minus_1* + 1 values of the *Sequence Header OBU*, a PixelAspectRatioBox box SHALL be present in the sampleentry and set such that

```
hSpacing / vSpacing = MaxRenderWidth * (max_frame_height_minus_1 + 1) / 
((max_frame_width_minus_1 + 1) * MaxRenderHeig
```
The **_compressorname_** field of the *VisualSampleEntry* is an informative name. It is formatted in a fixed32-byte field, with the first byte set to the number of bytes to be displayed, followed by that number of bytes of displayable data, followed by padding to complete 32 bytes total (including the size byte). The value "\012AOM Coding" is RECOMMENDED; the first byte is a count of the remaining bytes, here represented by \012, which (being octal 12) is decimal 10, the number of bytes in the rest of thestring.

```
NOTE: Parsers may ignore the value of the compressorname field. It is specified in this documentsimply for legacy and backwards compatibility reasons.
```

The **_config_** field SHALL contain an*AV1CodecConfigurationBox* that applies to the samples associat-ed with this sample entry

```
NOTE: Multiple instances of *AV1SampleEntry* may be required when the track contains samples
requiring a *AV1CodecConfigurationBox* with different characteristics.
```

Optional boxes not specifically mentioned here can be present, in particular those indicated in the defi-nition of the *VisualSampleEntry* in [ISOBMFF].

## AV1 Codec Configuration Box
### Definition

```
Box Type:  av1C 
Container: AV1 Sample Entry ('av01')
Mandatory: Yes
Quantity:  Exactly One
```

### Description

The **_AV1CodecConfigurationBox_** contains decoder configuration information that SHALL be valid for every sample that references the sample entry.

### Syntax

```
class AV1CodecConfigurationBox extends Box('av1C'){
  AV1CodecConfigurationRecord av1Config;
}

aligned (8) class AV1CodecConfigurationRecord {
 unsigned int (1) marker = 1;
 unsigned int (7) version = 1;
 unsigned int (3) seq_profile;
 unsigned int (5) seq_level_idx_0;
 unsigned int (1) seq_tier_0;
 unsigned int (1) high_bitdepth;
 unsigned int (1) twelve_bit;
 unsigned int (1) monochrome;
 unsigned int (1) chroma_subsampling_x;
 unsigned int (1) chroma_subsampling_y;
 unsigned int (2) chroma_sample_position;
 unsigned int (3) reserved = 0;

 unsigned int (1) initial_presentation_delay_present;
 if (initial_presentation_delay_present) {
 unsigned int (4) initial_presentation_delay_minus_one;  
 } else {
  unsigned int (4) reserved = 0;
 }
  unsigned int (8)[] configOBUs;
 }
```

### Semantics

The **_marker_** field SHALL be set to 1.

```
NOTE: The marker bit ensures that the bit pattern of the first byte of the AV1CodecConfiguration Record cannot be mistaken for an OBU Header byte.
```

The **_version_** field indicates the version of the AV1CodecConfigurationRecord. The value SHALL beset to 1 for AV1CodecConfiguration Record.

The **_seq_profile_** field indicates the AV1 profile and SHALL be equal to the seq_profile value from the *Sequence Header OBU*.

The **_seq_level_idx_0_** field indicates the value of seq_level_idx[0] found in the Sequence Header OBU and SHALL be equal to the value of seq_level_idx[0] in the *Sequence Header OBU*.

The **_seq_tier_0_** field indicates the value of seq_tier[0] found in the *Sequence Header OBU* and SHALLbe equal to the value of seq_tier[0] in the *Sequence Header OBU*.

The **_high_bitdepth_** field indicates the value of the *high_bitdepth* flag from the *Sequence Header OBU*.

The **_twelve_bit_** field indicates the value of the *twelve_bit* flag from the *Sequence Header OBU*.

The **_monochrome_** field indicates the value of the *mono_chrome* flag from the *Sequence Header OBU*.

The **_chroma_subsampling_x_** field indicates the *subsampling_x* value from the *Sequence Header OBU*.

The **_chroma_subsampling_y_** field indicates the *subsampling_y* value from the *Sequence Header OBU*.

The **_chroma_sample_position_** field indicates the *chroma_sample_position* value from the *SequenceHeader OBU*.

The **_initial_presentation_delay_present_** field indicates the presence of the initial_presentation_delay_minus_one field.

The **_initial_presentation_delay_minus_one_** field indicates the number of samples (minus one) that need to be decoded prior to starting the presentation of the first sample associated with this sample entry in order to guarantee that each sample will be decoded prior to its presentation time under the constraints of the first level value indicated by *seq_level_idx in* the *Sequence Header OBU* (in the config-OBUs field or in the associated samples). More precisely, the following procedure SHALL not return any error:

- construct a hypothetical bitstream consisting of the OBUs carried in the sample entry followed by the OBUs carried in all the samples referring to that sample entry,
- set the first *initial_display_delay_minus_1* field of each *Sequence Header OBU* to the number offrames minus one contained in the first *initial_presentation_delay_minus_one* + 1 samples,
- set the *frame_presentation_time* field of the frame header of each presentable frame such that it matches the presentation time difference between the sample carrying this frame and the previous sample (if it exists, 0 otherwise),
- apply the decoder model specified in [AV1] to this hypothetical bitstream using the first operating point. If **_buffer_removal_time_** information is present in bitstream for this operating point, the decoding schedule mode SHALL be applied, otherwise the resource availability mode SHALL be applied.

```
NOTE: With the above procedure, when smooth presentation can be guaranteed after decoding the
first sample, initial_presentation_delay_minus_one is 0.
```

```
NOTE: Because the above procedure considers all OBUs in all samples associated with a sample
entry, if these OBUS form multiple coded video sequences which would have different values of
initial_presentation_delay_minus_one if considered separately, the sample entry would
signal the larger value.
```

```
EXAMPLE 1
The difference between initial_presentation_delay_minus_one and initial_display_delay_minus_1 can be illustrated by considering the following example:

a b c d e f g h

where letters correspond to frames. Assume that initial_display_delay_minus_1 is 2, i.e. that once frame c has been decoded, all other frames in the bitstream can be presented on time. If those frames were grouped into temporal units and samples as follows:

[a] [b c d] [e] [f] [g] [h]

initial_presentation_delay_minus_one would be 1 because it takes presentation of 2 samples to ensure that c is decoded. But if the frames were grouped as follows:

[a] [b] [c] [d e f] [g] [h]

initial_presentation_delay_minus_one would be 2 because it takes presentation of 3 samples to ensure that c is decoded.
```

The **_configOBUs_** field contains zero or more OBUs. Any OBU may be present provided that the following procedures produce compliant AV1 bitstreams:

- From any sync sample, an *AV1 bitstream is formed by first outputting* the OBUs contained in the AV1CodecConfigurationBox and then by outputing all OBUs in the samples themselves, in order, starting from the sync sample.
- From any sample marked with the *AV1ForwardKeyFrameSampleGroupEntry*, an AV1 bitstream is formed by first outputting the OBUs contained in the *AV1CodecConfigurationBox* and then by outputing all OBUs in the sample itself, then by outputting all OBUs in the samples, in order, starting from the sample at the distance indicated by the sample group.

Additionally, the configOBUs field SHALL contain at most one *Sequence Header OBU* and if present, it SHALL be the first OBU.

```
NOTE: The configOBUs field is expected to contain only one Sequence Header OBU and zero or more *Metadata OBUs* when applicable to all the associated samples.
```

OBUs stored in the configOBUs field follow the *open_bitstream_unit Low Overhead Bitstream Format*
syntax as specified in [AV1]. The flag *obu_has_size_field* SHALL be set to 1, indicating that the
size of the OBU payload follows the header, and that it is coded using LEB128.

When a *Sequence Header OBU* is contained within the configOBUs of the AV1CodecConfiguration-
Record, the values present in the *Sequence Header OBU* contained within configOBUs SHALL match
the values of the AV1CodecConfigurationRecord.

The presentation times of AV1 samples are given by the ISOBMFF structures. The *timing_info_present_
flag* in the *Sequence Header OBU* (in the configOBUs field or in the associated samples)
SHOULD be set to 0. If set to 1, the *timing_info* structure of the *Sequence Header OBU*, the *frame_presentation_
time* and *buffer_removal_time* fields of the *Frame Header OBUs*, if present, SHALL be
ignored for the purpose of timed processing of the ISOBMFF file.

The sample entry SHOULD contain a *‘colr’* box with a colour_type set to *‘nclx’*. If present, the values
of colour_primaries, transfer_characteristics, and matrix_coefficients SHALL match the values given
in the *Sequence Header* OBU (in the configOBUs field or in the associated samples) if the color_description_
present_flag is set to 1. Similarly, the full_range_flag in the *‘colr’* box shall match the color_
range flag in the *Sequence Header OBU8. When configOBUs does not contain a *Sequence Header
OBU*, this box with colour_type set to *‘nclx’* SHALL be present.

The CleanApertureBox *‘clap’* SHOULD not be present.

For sample entries corresponding to HDR content, the MasteringDisplayColourVolumeBox *‘mdcv’*
and ContentLightLevelBox *‘clli’* SHOULD be present, and their values SHALL match the values of
contained in the *Metadata OBUs* of type METADATA_TYPE_HDR_CLL and METADATA_TYPE-
_HDR_MDCV, if present (in the configOBUs or in the samples).

```
NOTE: The MasteringDisplayColourVolumeBox ‘mdcv’ and ContentLightLevelBox ‘clli’ have
identical syntax to the SMPTE2086MasteringDisplayMetadataBox ‘SmDm’ and ContentLight-
LevelBox ‘CoLL’, except that they are of type Box and not FullBox. However, the semantics of
the MasteringDisplayColourVolumeBox and SMPTE2086MasteringDisplayMetadataBox have important
differences and should not be confused.
```

Additional boxes may be provided at the end of the *VisualSampleEntry* as permitted by ISOBMFF,
that may represent redundant or similar information to the one provided in some OBUs contained in
the *AV1CodecConfigurationBox*. If the box definition does not indicate that its information overrides
the OBU information, in case of conflict, the OBU information should be considered authoritative.

## AV1 Sample Format

For tracks using the *AV1SampleEntry*, an **_AV1 Sample_** has the following constraints:

- the sample data SHALL be a sequence of *OBUs* forming a *Temporal Unit*,
- each OBU SHALL follow the *open_bitstream_unit Low Overhead Bitstream Format* syntax as
specified in [AV1]. Each OBU SHALL have the *obu_has_size_field* set to 1 except for the last
OBU in the sample, for which obu_has_size_field MAY be set to 0, in which case it is assumed to
fill the remainder of the sample,

```
NOTE: When extracting OBUs from an ISOBMFF file, and depending on the capabilities of thedecoder processing these OBUs, ISOBMFF parsers MAY need to either: set the obu_has_size_- field to 1 for some OBUs if not already set, add the size field in this case, and add Temporal Delimiter OBU; or use the length-delimited bitstream format as defined in Annex B of AV1. If encryption is used, similar operations MAY have to be done before or after decryption depending on the demuxer/decryptor/decoder architecture.
```

- OBU trailing bits SHOULD be limited to byte alignment and SHOULD not be used for padding,
- OBUs of type OBU_TEMPORAL_DELIMITER, OBU_PADDING, or OBU_REDUNDAN-T_FRAME_HEADER SHOULD NOT be used.
- OBUs of type OBU_TILE_LIST SHALL NOT be used.

If an AV1 Sample is signaled as a sync sample (in the SyncSampleBox or by setting sample_is_non_-sync_sample to 0), it SHALL be a Random Access Point as defined in [AV1], i.e. satisfy the followingconstraints:

- Its first frame is a *Key Frame* that has *show_frame8 flag set to 1,
- It contains a *Sequence Header OBU* before the first *Frame Header OBU*.

```
NOTE: Within this definition, a sync sample may contain additional frames that are not KeyFrames. The fact that none of them is the first frame in the temporal unit ensures that they aredecodable.
```

```
NOTE: Other types of OBUs such as *metadata OBUs* could be present before the *Sequence Header OBU*.
```

*Intra-only frames* SHOULD be signaled using the sample_depends_on flag set to 2.

*Delayed Random Access Points* SHOULD be signaled using sample groups and the *AV1ForwardKey-FrameSampleGroupEntry*.

*Switch Frames* SHOULD be signaled using sample groups and the *AV1SwitchFrameSampleGroupEn-try*.

Additionally, if a file contains multiple tracks that are alternative representations of the same content,in particular using *Switch Frames*, those tracks SHOULD be marked as belonging to the same alter-nate group and should use a track selection box with an appropriate attribute (e.g. *‘bitr’*).

In tracks using the *AV1SampleEntry*, the ‘ctts’ box and composition offsets in movie fragmentsSHALL NOT be used. Similarly, the is_leading flag, if used, SHALL be set to 0 or 2.

When a temporal unit contains more than one frame, the sample corresponding to that temporal unitMAY be marked using the *AV1MultiFrameSampleGroupEntry*.

*Metadata OBUs* may be carried in sample data. In this case, the *AV1MetadataSampleGroupEntry* SHOULD be used. If the *metadata OBUs* are static for the entire set of samples associated with a giv-en sample description entry, they SHOULD also be in the OBU array in the sample description entry.

Unless explicitely stated, the grouping_type_parameter is not defined for the SampleToGroupBox withgrouping types defined in this specification.

## AV1 Forward Key Frame sample group entry

### Definition

```
Group Type:av1f
Container: Sample Group Description Box ('sgpd')
Mandatory: No
Quantity:  Zero or more.
```

### Description

The **_AV1ForwardKeyFrameSampleGroupEntry_** documents samples that contain a *Delayed Random Access Point* that are followed at a given distance in the bitstream by a *Key Frame Dependent Recovery Point*.

### Syntax

```
class AV1ForwardKeyFrameSampleGroupEntry extends VisualSampleGroupEntry('av1  
unsigned int(8) fwd_distance;
}
```

### Semantics

The **_fwd_distance_** field indicates the number of samples between this sample and the next sample con-taining the associated *Key Frame Dependent Recovery Point*. 0 means the next sample.

## AV1 Multi-Frame sample group entry

### Definition

```
Group Type: av1m
Container:  Sample Group Description Box ('sgpd')
Mandatory:  No
Quantity:   Zero or more.
```

### Description

The **_AV1MultiFrameSampleGroupEntry_** documents samples that contain multiple frames.

### Syntax

```
class AV1MultiFrameSampleGroupEntry extends VisualSampleGroupEntry('av1m') {
}
```

## AV1 Switch Frame sample group entry

### Definition

```
Group Type: av1s
Container:  Sample Group Description Box ('sgpd')
Mandatory:  No
Quantity:   Zero or more
```

### Description

The **_AV1SwitchFrameSampleGroupEntry_** documents samples that start with a *Switch Frame*.

### Syntax

```
class AV1SwitchFrameSampleGroupEntry extends VisualSampleGroupEntry('av1s') 
}
```

## AV1 Metadata sample group entry

### Definition

```
Group Type: av1M
Container:  Sample Group 
Description Box ('sgpd')
Mandatory:  No
Quantity:   Zero or more.
```

### Description

The AV1MetadataSampleGroupEntry documents samples that contain *metadata OBUs*. Thegrouping_type_parameter can be used to identify samples containing *metadata OBUs* of a giventype. If no grouping_type_parameter is provided, the sample group entry identifies samples con-taining *metadata OBUs* for which the metadata_type is unknown.

 ### Syntax
 
```
class AV1MetadataSampleGroupEntry extends VisualSampleGroupEntry('av1M') {
}
```

For this sample group entry, the grouping_type_parameter syntax is as follows

```
{   
   unsigned int (8) metadata_type;   
   unsigned int (24) metadata_specific_parameters;
}
```

### Semantics

**_metadata_type_** is a 8-bit field whose value is the value of the metadata_type field defined in [AV1],when it is equal or lower than 255. metadata_type values above 255 are not supported by this samplegroup.

**_metadata_specific_parameters provides_** an additional part of the grouping_type_parameter,which MAY be used to distinguish different sample groups having the same metadata_type but dif-ferent sub-parameters. In this version of the specification, metadata_specific_parameters is only defined when metadata_type is set to METADATA_TYPE_ITUT_T35 in which case its value SHALL be set to the first 24 bits of the metadata_itut_t35 structure. For other types of metadata,its value SHOULD be set to 0. In all cases, when the grouping_type_parameter is used, readers processing sample groups SHALL use the entire value of grouping_type_parameter.

# CMAF AV1 track format

[CMAF] defines structural constraints on ISOBMFF files additional to [ISOBMFF] for the purpose of, for example, adaptive streaming or for protected files. Conformance to these structural constraints issignaled by the presence of the brand cmfc in the FileTypeBox.

If a CMAF Video Track uses the brand av01, it is called a CMAF AV1 Track and the following con-straints, defining the CMAF Media Profile for AV1, apply:

- it SHALL use an *AV1SampleEntry*
- it MAY use multiple sample entries, and in that case the following values SHALL not change inthe track:
  - seq_profile
  - still_picture
  - the first value of seq_level_idx
  - the first value of seq_tier
  - color_config
  - initial_presentation_delay_minus_one

When protected, *CMAF AV1 Tracks* SHALL use the signaling defined in [CMAF], which in turn re-lies on [CENC], with the provisions specified in *§4 Common Encryption*.

# Common Encryption

*CMAF AV1 Tracks* and non-segmented AV1 files MAY be protected. If protected, they SHALL con-form to [CENC]. Only the *cenc* and *cbcs* protection schemes are supported.

When the protected scheme *cenc* is used, samples SHALL be protected using subsample encryption and SHALL NOT use pattern encryption.

When the protected scheme *cbcs* is used, samples SHALL be protected using subsample encryption and SHALL use pattern encryption. [CENC] recommends that the Pattern Block length be 10, i.e. crypt_byte_block + skip_byte_block = 10. All combinations such that this is true SHALL be supported, including crypt_byte_block = 10 and skip_byte_block = 0.

## General Subsample Encryption constraints

Within protected samples, the following constraints apply:

- Protected samples SHALL be exactly spanned by one or more contiguous subsamples.
  - An OBU MAY be spanned by one or more subsamples, especially when it has multiple ranges of protected data. However, as recommended in [CENC], writers SHOULD reduce the number of subsamples as possible. This can be achieved by using a subsample that spans multiple consecutive unprotected OBUs as well as the first unprotected and protected partsof the following protected OBU, if such protected OBU exists.
  - A large unprotected OBU whose data size is larger than the maximum size of a single *Bytes-Of ClearData* field MAY be spanned by multiple subsamples with zero size *BytesOfPro-tectedData*.

- All *OBU Headers* and associated *obu_size* fields SHALL be unprotected.
- *Temporal Delimiter OBUs, Sequence Header OBUs*, and *Frame Header OBUs* (including withina *Frame OBU*), *Redundant Frame Header OBUs* and *Padding OBUs* SHALL be unprotected.
- *Metadata OBUs* MAY be protected.
- *Tile Group OBUs* and *Frame OBUs* SHALL be protected. Within *Tile Group OBUs* or *Frame OBUs*, the following applies:

  - A subsample SHALL be created for each tile.
  - *BytesOfProtectedData* SHALL be a multiple of 16 bytes.
  - *BytesOfProtectedData* SHALL end on the last byte of the decode_tile structure (includ-ing any trailing bits).
  - *BytesOfProtectedData* SHALL span all complete 16-byte blocks of the decode_tile struc-ture (including any trailing bits).

```
NOTE: As a result of the above, partial blocks are not used and it is possible that BytesOfPro-tectedData does not start at the first byte 
of the decode_tile structure, but some number of bytes following that.
```

 - All other parts of *Tile Group OBUs* and *Frame OBUs* SHALL be unprotected.

# Codecs Parameter String

DASH and other applications require defined values for the *‘Codecs’* parameter specified in [RFC6381] for ISO Media tracks. The codecs parameter string for the AOM AV1 codec is as follows:

```
<sample entry 4CC>.<profile>.<level><tier>.<bitDepth>.<monochrome>.<chromaSu<colorPrimaries>.<transferCharacteristics>.<matrixCoefficients>.<videoFullRa
```

All fields following the sample entry 4CC are expressed as double digit decimals, unless indicated otherwise. Leading or trailing zeros cannot be omitted.

The profile parameter value, represented by a single digit decimal, SHALL equal the value of seq_pro-file in the *Sequence Header OBU*.

The level parameter value SHALL equal the first level value indicated by *seq_level_idx* in the *Se-quence Header OBU*.

The tier parameter value SHALL be equal to M when the first *seq_tier* value in the *Sequence Header OBU* is equal to 0, and H when it is equal to 1.

The bitDepth parameter value SHALL equal the value of BitDepth variable as defined in [AV1] de-rived from the Sequence Header OBU.

The monochrome parameter value, represented by a single digit decimal, SHALL equal the value ofmono_chrome in the Sequence Header OBU.

The chromaSubsampling parameter value, represented by a three-digit decimal, SHALL have its first digit equal to subsampling_x and its second digit equal to subsampling_y. If both subsampling_x and subsampling_y are set to 1, then the third digit SHALL be equal to chroma_sample_position, other-wise it SHALL be set to 0.

The colorPrimaries, transferCharacteristics, matrixCoefficients, and videoFullRangeFlag parameter values SHALL equal the value of matching fields in the *Sequence Header OBU*, if color_descrip-tion_present_flag is set to 1, otherwise they SHOULD not be set, defaulting to the values below. The videoFullRangeFlag is represented by a single digit.

For example, codecs="av01.0.04M.10.0.112.09.16.09.0" represents AV1 Main Profile, level 3.0, Main tier, 10-bit content, non-monochrome, with 4:2:0 chroma subsampling co-located with (0, 0) lumasample, ITU-R BT.2100 color primaries, ITU-R BT.2100 PQ transfer characteristics, ITU-R BT.2100 YCbCr color matrix, and studio swing representation.

The parameters sample entry 4CC, profile, level, tier, and bitDepth are all mandatory fields. If any of these fields are empty, or not within their allowed range, the processing device SHOULD treat it as an error.

All the other fields (including their leading '.') are optional, mutually inclusive (all or none) fields. Ifnot specified then the values listed in the table below are assumed

```
mono_chrome                0
chromaSubsampling          110 (4:2:0)
colorPrimaries             1 (ITU-R BT.709)
transferCharacteristics    1 (ITU-R BT.709)
matrixCoefficients         1 (ITU-R BT.709)
videoFullRangeFlag         0 (studio swing representation)
```

The string codecs="av01.0.01M.08" in this case would represent AV1 Main Profile, level 2.1, Main tier, 8-bit content with 4:2:0 chroma subsampling, ITU-R BT.709 color primaries, transfer characteristics, matrix coefficients, and studio swing representation. 

If any character that is not '.', digits, part of the AV1 4CC, or a tier value is encountered, the string SHALL be interpreted ignoring all the characters starting from that character.

# Conformance

Conformance requirements are expressed with a combination of descriptive assertions and RFC 2119 terminology. The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”,“SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in the normative parts of this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. However, for readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase letters in this specification.

All of the text of this specification is normative except sections explicitly marked as non-normative, examples, and notes. [RFC2119]

Examples in this specification are introduced with the words “for example” or are set apart from the normative text with class="example", like this
